```{r }
library(leaflet)
BELGAUM <- c("<a href= 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgaum")
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lat=15.85, lng=74.5, popup = BELGAUM) 
```






Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
